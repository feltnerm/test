                <section class="sub-section">
                    <p>Hotels are expected to be booked fast because of Parents' Weekend at the local University so make sure to book yours soon.</p>

            <h4 id="accomodations-downtown">Downtown on the Isthmus</h4>
            <p>These hotels will offer the most convenience, at a higher price, and limited availability.</p>
            <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.concoursehotel.com/">Madison Concourse</a></li>

            <h4 id="accomodations-outer">A Little Further</h4>
            <p>Downtown can be a bit crazy. Fortunately, there are plenty of options just outside that are only a 15-20 minute drive away from everything.</p>
